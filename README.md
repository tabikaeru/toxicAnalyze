You can use this web apps only for English texts or twitter user who only tweet English texts.
Dataset comes from https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data
This is first time for me that I made web apps in Python Django.
So my code and file names are weired....

How to execute

$ python /toxicAnalyze/DjangoExmaple/manage.py runserver

How to use
put your twitter ID or texts.

But if you put a twitter ID who has too much tweets, it will take so many times...

So please test it by the twitter ID "adeo2yuichi"
